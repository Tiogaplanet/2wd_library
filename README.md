# 2wd Library

2wd is my made-from-scratch robot whose hardware development can be tracked in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Tiogaplanet/2wd).  This repository contains the library needed to program 2wd using the Arduino IDE.

## What is 2wd?

2wd is a two-wheeled robot with a low center of gravity and built around the Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller.  It is made up of parts I've cobbled together, mostly purchased from Amazon or Pololu.

## What can it do?

Right now, not much.  There is stll much assembly to be done.  It can turn its wheels and display messages on the OLED display.  The goal is to assemble it with, at minimum, forward- and rear-facing IR distance sensors and use this library to enable the motion sensors on the two gear motors, the IR sensors and all of the sensors onboard the 33 IoT.
